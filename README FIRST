BeMobile is a simple program to manage contacts and messages stored on your mobile phone.
Currently it is possible only to browse phonebook and SMS storage. Editing options will
come in the future, as well as data import and export. It has been developed for Motorola
C550 but should work with any phone that supports AT command set.



COMPATIBILITY

BeMobile works only with phones that can be driven with AT commands. It has been developed
and tested ONLY on a Motorola C550. It should work on some other models too, like Siemens,
Ericsson and some Nokia phones.
To make a long story short - if SerialConnect can talk with your phone via infra-red link,
RS232 or USB cable, then BeMobile should work too.



OPTIONS

There are really only two interesting menu items:
- Set date and time - set date and time on the phone according to computer clock
- Monitor status - disable this when troubleshooting, it won't fill the log with uninteresting
  data about phone battery status, network signal strength etc.



NOKIA

I expect that this will come often - NO, MOST LIKELY IT WILL NOT RUN WITH YOUR NOKIA.
As far as I know, most Nokia phones use something different than plain old modem AT commands.
If you're really interested, you should port gnokii (XXX:URL) to BeOS, or convince someone
to do it. Myself, I don't have a Nokia phone, so buy me one before asking about compatibility
with Nokias :)



TROUBLESHOOTING

If the program doesn't work or interprets some data wrong or can't gather data at all, please
send me full information about your phone, link type and (most important) communication log.
The log is by default enabled and saved in your home directory as 'bemobile.log'. Please
try all options that don't work as they should 



HELP

Do you want to help? I'll be more than happy to receive any donations and reports (both success
and failure).
